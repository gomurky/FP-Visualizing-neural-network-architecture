	abstract = {Maneuvering in both natural and artificial miniature flying systems is assumed to be dominated by aerodynamic phenomena. To explore this, we develop a flapping wing model integrating aero and inertial dynamics. The model is applied to an elliptical wing similar to the forewing of the Hawkmoth Manduca sexta and realistic kinematics are prescribed. We scrutinize the stroke deviation phase, as it relates to firing latency in airborne insect steering muscles which has been correlated to various aerial maneuvers. We show that the average resultant force production acting on the body largely arises from wing pitch and roll and is insensitive to the phase and amplitude of stroke deviation. Inclusion of stroke deviation can generate significant averaged aerodynamic torques at steady-state and adjustment of its phase can facilitate body attitude control. Moreover, averaged wing angular momentum varies with stroke deviation phase, implying a non-zero impulse during a time-dependent phase shift. Simulations show wing inertial and aerodynamic impulses are of similar magnitude during short transients whereas aerodynamic impulses dominate during longer transients. Additionally, inertial effects become less significant for smaller flying insects. Body yaw rates arising from these impulses are consistent with biologically measured values. Thus, we conclude (1) modest changes in stroke deviation can significantly affect steering and (2) both aerodynamic and inertial torques are critical to maneuverability, the latter of which has not widely been considered. Therefore, the addition of a control actuator modulating stroke deviation may decouple lift/thrust production from steering mechanisms in flapping wing micro aerial vehicles and increase vehicle dexterity through inertial trajectory shaping.}

abstract = "Both flapping insect and robotic wings undergo structural deformation during flight. Deformation gives rise to considerable strain energy storage, and this energy can be recovered to accelerate/decelerate the wing over a flapping cycle. This mechanism is believed to reduce the inertial power requirements of flight. To investigate this, we develop a reduced-order flapping wing model integrating flexible structural mechanics and rigid aerodynamics. The model is applicable only for wings that experience small deformation with respect to prescribed rigid body motion. We apply the model to a simplified hawkmoth Manduca sexta forewing. The idealized wing is first assumed to undergo single degree-of-freedom rotation in vacuum. We determine that a tuned compliant wing requires 20% less RMS mechanical power than a rigid flapping wing with identical kinematics. The model is then applied to a wing undergoing three-dimensional rotation in air, and optimal flapping kinematics and wing fundamental frequency are determined. Optimized rotation amplitudes and fundamental frequency agree within reason to biologically observed values with the largest discrepancy occurring in pitching amplitude. The optimal flapping-to-fundamental frequency ratio is ω∕ω1 ≈ 0.35, though compliance reduces overall energetic expenditures over a wide range of frequency ratios. Under the optimal configuration, compliance reduces RMS power by 25% compared to a rigid wing, suggesting wing flexibility plays a significant role in insect flight efficiency. These results highlight the necessity for modal testing of robotic flapping wings. The natural frequency of the wing can be tuned by varying the effective diameter of the wing strut such that maximal efficiency is achieved. Tuned elastic wings can be used with other compliant drivetrain components to maximize energy efficiency in flapping-wing robots."

abstract = "Bio-inspired flapping wing has potential application to micro air vehicles (MAV). Due to the nature of lightweight and flexibility of micro flapping wing structures, elastic deformation as a result of aeroelastic coupling is inevitable in flapping motion. This effect can be significant and beneficial to the aerodynamic performance as revealed in the present investigation for a flexible flapping wing of variable camber versus a rigid one. Firstly a two dimensional (2D) unsteady aerodynamic model (UAM) based on potential flow theory has been extended from previous study. Both leading and trailing edge discrete vortices are included in the model with unsteady Kutta condition satisfied to fully characterize the unsteady flow around a flapping wing. A wall function is created to modify the induced velocity of the vortices in the UAM to solve the vortices penetration problem. The modified UAM is then validated by comparing with CFD results of a typical insect-like flapping motion from previous research. Secondly the UAM is further extended for a flexible flapping wing of camber variation. Comparing with a rigid wing in a prescribed plunging and pitching motion, the results show lift increase with positive camber in upstroke by mitigating negative lift. The results also agree well with CFD simulation. Thirdly the 2D UAM is extended to calculate the aerodynamic forces of a 3D wing with camber variation, and validated by CFD results. Finally the model is applied to aerodynamic analysis of a 3D flexible flapping wing with aeroelastic coupling effect. Significant increase of lift coefficient can be achieved for a flexible flapping wing of positive camber and twist in upstroke produced by the structure elastic deformation."

	abstract = {The inverse problem of hovering flight, that is, the range of wing movements appropriate for sustained flight at a fixed position and orientation, was examined by developing a simulation of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. Inverse problems arise when one is seeking the parameters that are required to achieve a specified model outcome. In contrast, forward problems explore the outcomes given a specified set of input parameters. The simulation was coupled to a microgenetic algorithm that found specific sequences of wing and body motions, encoded by ten independent kinematic parameters, capable of generating the fixed body position and orientation characteristic of hovering flight. Additionally, we explored the consequences of restricting the number of free kinematic parameters and used this information to assess the importance to flight control of individual parameters and various combinations of them. Output from the simulated moth was compared to kinematic recordings of hovering flight in real hawkmoths; the real and simulated moths performed similarly with respect to their range of variation in position and orientation. The simulated moth also used average wingbeat kinematics (amplitude, stroke plane orientation, etc) similar to those of the real moths. However, many different subsets of the available kinematic were sufficient for hovering flight and available kinematic data from real moths does not include sufficient detail to assess which, if any, of these was consistent with the real moth. This general result, the multiplicity of possible hovering kinematics, shows that the means by which Manduca sexta actually maintains position and orientation may have considerable freedom and therefore may be influenced by many other factors beyond the physical and aerodynamic requirements of hovering flight.},

	abstract = {Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual{\textendash}abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth Manduca sexta to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus{\textendash}response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic{\textendash}abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or {\textquoteleft}airframe{\textquoteright} of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.},

	abstract = {Flight speeds and behaviors of the sphinx moth Manduca sexta were recorded in chambers of four different sizes (0.57, 8.5, 44 and 447 m3). Mean horizontal speed increased linearly with the cube root of chamber volume from 0.57 m s-1 in the smallest chamber to 3.4 m s-1 in the largest. The maximum horizontal speed observed was 5.3 m s-1 in the largest chamber. Speeds decreased linearly with the logarithm of hawkmoth proximity to the wall. In a tunnel chamber (the third largest), moths often flew in a scalloped-shaped path. At the top of the scallop, they glided for 1\&amp;shy;5 wing beats. In the largest chamber, moths could be recorded flying at angles other than horizontal (0 \&amp;deg;). At flight angles greater or less than 0 \&amp;deg;, mean speed decreased linearly with angle until \&amp;plusmn;40 \&amp;deg;. At greater angles, speeds remained between 1 and 2 m s-1. Moths also flew closer to the wall at flight angles deviating from the horizontal. An allometric analysis of the flight speeds of insects and birds suggests that M. sexta may be able to fly at 7\&amp;shy;10 m s-1.

abstract="1.Male and female Manduca sexta flew upwind in response to the odor of female sex-pheromone gland extract or fresh tobacco leaf respectively, and generated very similar zigzagging tracks along the odor plume.2.After loss of odor during flight, males and females alike: (1) first flew slower and steered their flight more across the wind, then (2) stopped moving upwind, and finally (3) regressed downwind.3.Males flying upwind in a pheromone plume in wind of different velocities maintained their ground speed near a relatively constant `preferred' value by increasing their air speed as the velocity of the wind increased, and also maintained the average angle of their resultant flight tracks with respect to the wind at a preferred value by steering a course more precisely due upwind.4.The inter-turn duration and turn rate, two measures of the temporal aspects of the flight track, were maintained, on average, with remarkable consistency across all wind velocities and in both sexes. The inter-turn durations also decreased significantly as moths approached the odor source, suggesting modulation of the temporal pattern of turning by some feature of the odor plume. This temporal regularity of turning appears to be one of the most stereotyped features of odor-modulated flight in M. sexta.",

abstract={We present a new approach to motion planning using a stochastic trajectory optimization framework. The approach relies on generating noisy trajectories to explore the space around an initial (possibly infeasible) trajectory, which are then combined to produced an updated trajectory with lower cost. A cost function based on a combination of obstacle and smoothness cost is optimized in each iteration. No gradient information is required for the particular optimization algorithm that we use and so general costs for which derivatives may not be available (e.g. costs corresponding to constraints and motor torques) can be included in the cost function. We demonstrate the approach both in simulation and on a mobile manipulation system for unconstrained and constrained tasks. We experimentally show that the stochastic nature of STOMP allows it to overcome local minima that gradient-based methods like CHOMP can get stuck in.},
